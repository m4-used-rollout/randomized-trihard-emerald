After Mt. Chimney:
- The boss mentions keeping in touch.
	- He should give the player, not his number but Matt's number.
	- Jessica and Bailey should also have phone numbers and be callable.
- There's a random Magma Grunt in Jagged Pass as you're passing through. 
	- Remember this, and allow the player to suggest it to Jessica while in the base, looking for the Magma Base with the amulet thingy.
